POST HACKATHON

A Small list of improvements that can be made to improve the
performance and/or the readability of the code.

1. Very repetitvie If statements, within the insertiion and
	clustering algorithms. Possibly, the graph could be redesigned
	to take better use of polymorphism.

2.Implement the use of some data structure to monitor what nodes have
	been already added to the cluster.  This will reduce the amount of time
	we traverse over nodes that have been already covered within the graph. Also
	will reduce the repition when printing out all of the clusters (set intersection?)
