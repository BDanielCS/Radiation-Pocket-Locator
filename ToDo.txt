1. Ensure the addition works properly in All directions
	--infinte loop on multi direction additions                     X
2. Ensure the size maintains the number of nodes properly           X
3. Ensure delete properly frees all memory
	--Destructor finish
	--delete of centroid vacant val
	--delete of node chain re assigns pointers
	--master cleaner that removes double linked vacant nodes
4. Ensures that clusters function can work for different sizes in sparse graphs
	--yeah it works for now, but polymorphism?


***********************************************************************************
Test Cases
1. Generation of graph
2. Proper size on default generation
3. Proper empty nodes on default generation
4. Parsing of line properly splits up the coordinate from the value
5. each directional is placed into each vector while maintaining its order
6. each distnace is place into its vector while maintaining order
7. The '-' character is always recognized as the end of coordinate
8. Integer parsed correctly at any length
9. Addition onto centroid 'C' updates its value. (no node created)
10. Simple addition to empty graph properly adjusts each pointer of the pointers
11. Proper addition to graph in one direction that requires a recurse farther into the graph
12. Addition of a node between two nodes and adjust all pointers properly
13. Successful addition of node that has two directional coordinate
14. Successful addition of node that has three directional coordinate
15. Successful empty node place with proper coordinate update
16. Permutations properly list all permutations of coordinate
17. ONLY update value for equivalent coordinate ( N2A2 == A2N2)
18. Update value if node already exists in graph
19. Removal of node sets value to vacant.
20. If node not in graph, do nothing for removal
21.Clustering properly determines if nodes are within specified distance from each other
22. Clustering extends as far as possible, but stops at specified distance base case
23. Clustering does not skip any directions for any level of recursion
24. Clustering hits all nodes
25. Addition works properly in all directions
